#### Bio
Mohamed is Senior Applied Science Manager at Amazon Alexa. He was Director of AI for Cisco's Contact Center solutions. Cisco has recently acquired Voicea, where Mohamed was a Co-Founder and Chief Architect; he also worked on ASR, NLP, and interacting with EVA (the Enterprise Voice Assistant). At LinkedIn and Microsoft, Mohamed led AI and big data teams that served hundreds of millions of users. Mohamed co-authored a book, [Computing with Data](https://computingwithdata.com/), which explores the big data industry. He also was a Teaching Assistant for Machine Learning (CS229) and Deep Learning (CS230) at Stanford University.
Mohamed is an avid [calligrapher](https://www.facebook.com/elgeishArtCorner) and [photographer](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/elgeish?assettype=image&sort=mostpopular); in 2011, [one of his shots](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/three-little-turtles-getting-ready-to-dive-into-a-pond-gm91769997-9703250) made it as Bing.com's wallpaper; a few more got published in books after that. Before COVID-19, Mohamed loved to travel.

#### A Guide Book to the Data Industry

* Introduces programmers to data science concepts and practices through new
apparatuses such as Python programming and data processing techniques
* Explains prevalent programming languages and data processing systems that
are commonly used to address engineering challenges
* Explores new tools and libraries to use in big data projects
* Presents principles that can be employed in applications ranging from
software simulations to real-world web applications that serve millions of
users
* Contains a plethora of examples used to explain various interconnected
concepts; most of the code samples on this website are __editable__
and __runnable__ in an interactive web-based IDE; for example, try editing
[this code snippet](https://tech.io/playground-widget/17892943edf13cf159936a03cd286a8442992/surface-plots/506728) then run it.
